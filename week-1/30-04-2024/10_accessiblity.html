        Always write HTML code with accessibility in mind!

        Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible.
    -->

    <!-- Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud. -->

    <!-- 
        The screen reader reads each header out as you progress through the content, notifying you what a heading is, what is a paragraph, etc.
        
        It stops after each element, letting you go at whatever pace is comfortable for you.
        
        You can jump to the next/previous heading in many screen readers.
        
        You can also bring up a list of all headings in many screen readers, allowing you to use them as a handy table of contents to find specific content.

    <h1>My heading</h1>

    <p>This is the first section of my document.</p>

    <p>I'll add another paragraph here too.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Here is</li>
        <li>a list for</li>
        <li>you to read</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My subheading</h2>

    <p>
        This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be able to
        find this content!
    </p>

    <h2>My 2nd subheading</h2>

    <p>
        This is the second subsection of my content, which I think is more interesting
        than the last one.
