    <p>According to Wikipedia, A water bottle is a container that is used to hold liquids, mainly water, for the purpose
        of transporting a drink while travelling or while otherwise away from a supply of potable water</p>

    <p>Water bottles are usually made of plastic, glass, metal, or some combination of those substances. In the past,
        water bottles were sometimes made of wood, bark, or animal skins such as leather, hide and sheepskin.</p>

    <p>Water bottles can be either disposable or reusable. Disposable water bottles are often sold filled with potable
        water, while reusable bottles are often sold empty. Reusable water bottles help cut down on consumer plastic
        waste and carbon emissions.[citation needed]. A reusable water bottle designed for outdoor activities is also
        called a canteen.</p>
